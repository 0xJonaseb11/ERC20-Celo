Create an `ERC20` token and deploy it on `CELO network`

### Why Choose `CELO`??
Why Celo? Celo is the PoS Layer-1 protocol that supports developing dApps and helps to build a carbon-negative financial system. Celo achieves being carbon-negative through a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, carbon offsetting, incentivizing regenerative behavior, and introducing natural capital-backed currencies. These measures aim to reduce resource usage, offset negative impacts, and encourage environmental renewal, building a system that sustains and renews environmental resources.
